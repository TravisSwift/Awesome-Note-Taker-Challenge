## Takeaway 

Learning to work with routes and NPM modules was the most benificial part of this project. 


If I had more time I would update the style sheets with different colors for the backgrounds, add labels to the "save" and "new note" icons, and a visable time stamp on the notes. If the user could choose different background colors for the notes and be able to organize notes by dragging  would be cool additions as well.
